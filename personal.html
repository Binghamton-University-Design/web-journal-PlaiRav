			<p>For my digital storytelling project I’d like to create a visual moving documentary of the history of hip hop in New York City. I would use the combination of photographs and music to create a cohesive narrative of the 1970s and 1980s in New York. I would include interactive buttons to slide to the next page as well as photographs, including audio and text to give context and tell a story. The project would consist of a combination of photos and videos to play. The point of the project is to immerse the audience as much as possible into the environment and the culture of that time and place. Through historical photographs the people and vibrant history of this era will be constructed through these vignettes. I would use a map of the city and take the viewer to the different parts of the city at which the photographs were taken. Giving the audience an even greater understanding of the setting, being able to see the geography of the city and where everything was happening. At various points in the chronological history, I would have the map of New York laid out with different indicators at different locations throughout the city. These indicators would take the audience to that location and show the documented images and stories of the things that took place there. I’d like these photos to have a certain level of dynamicity to them, moving around and having certain levels of depth in the way that they are presented. Perhaps photos layered on top of each other, which a slight movement to them as they are placed there. I’d like the music to match with the specific years that the visual documentary is taking place in, as well as certain audio clips of voices to be telling stories as well. 
	Hip hop made its roots in parties in the Bronx, which largely affected the genre’s development. It’s “mix of vocal techniques and storytelling traditions from those cultures, and the fluidity and ease with which early rap artists moved among musical styles all combined to launch a new form of expression for young men and women in New York City in the 1970s,” are all significant in developing hip hop to what it is today.
The genre’s ability to continuously reinvent itself to reflect an ever changing culture while maintaining its foundations of self expression and empowerment is part of what makes it so popular. “Hip-hop speaks to the cultural needs and desires of particular communities who have often been marginalized,” according to radio host, hip-hop journalist and professor at San Francisco State University, David Cook in an interview with The Hoya. He goes on to say; “It was really a cultural response to certain political, social, economic challenges that were facing a group of people who were being made invisible and abandoned by New York City’s government.”
Starting from the 1970s I would document the birth of hip-hop, and the climate that birthed it, and gradually progress throughout history seeing how the culture evolved as well as the city. Crime in New York peaked in the 1980s and 90s with the surging crack epidemic, which plagued primarily black communities. This era of New York is some of the harshest, and darkest parts of its history. But from it proliferated a vibrant culture that has its grips in pop culture all around the world. Crime on the subway peaked in the 1970s and 1980s, and often buildings in the Bronx were burned down for insurance money, or simply for destructive purposes. It was often said during those times, “The Bronx is burning.” There has been vast documentation of this era with countless photographs, videos, candid interviews, and first hand accounts. 
Both hip hop culture has birthed some of the most popular music across the nation, accounting for 21.7% of total music consumption in the United States. However, hip-hop is far from exclusive to the US. Nearly every country has some local variation of hip-hop with its own characteristics stemming from the genre’s American foundation in the 1980s. Some examples include Korean hip hop— also known as “K hip hop”— which is similar in that artists will use syllables that best fit their rhymes in both languages, yet its content differs from its American counterpart with idioms of Confucianism which reflects the values of genre’s ultimate audience. Another example is French hip hop, which shares similar themes of struggle as it speaks to the oppression faced by the Muslim community in France. In the same way, hip hop was created as a response to the growing urban environment and lifestyle in the US.
